#So Long
This is an implementation of the 42 project so_long

## Usage
To build, use make. It will build the included mlx library and link it with my project.

Then you can launch ./SoLong map.ber

## Map
- The map must be composed of only 5 possible characters: 0 for an empty
space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for map exit and P for the playerâ€™s
starting position.
- A map need to be rectangular and surrounded by walls ('1')
- Map must have at least one exit, one collectible, and one starting position
Map example :
```
1111111111111111111111111111111111
1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001
1010010100100000101001000000010101
1010010010101010001001000000010101
1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1
1111111111111111111111111111111111
```

## Compatibility
- My project works on MacOS with x86 and M1
- It will probably run on Linux, but untested
